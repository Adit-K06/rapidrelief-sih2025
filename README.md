- Live GPS tracking with precise latitude and longitude
- Interactive map interface powered by Google Maps
- Dynamic route visualization
- Automatic mission phase transitions (Approach â†’ Hover â†’ Return)

### 2. Telemetry Monitoring
- Battery level monitoring with visual indicators
- Altitude tracking in meters
- Real-time speed monitoring in m/s
- Mission timer with elapsed time display

### 3. Flight Control
- **Recording Control**: Start/Stop mission recording
- **Return to Base**: Automated return function with confirmation
- **Emergency Landing**: Quick access emergency protocols
- **Mission Status**: Real-time status updates with color-coded indicators

### 4. Activity Logging
- Chronological mission events log
- Color-coded message types:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Success (Green)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Warning (Yellow)
  - ðŸ”´ Error (Red)
- Timestamp for each event

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- React Native

```

## Usage Guide

### Mission Control
1. Launch the application
2. View real-time drone position on the map
3. Monitor telemetry data:
   - Battery status
   - Altitude
   - Speed
   - Mission duration

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Return to Base**
   - Press "Return to Base" button
   - Confirm action in dialog
   - Monitor return trajectory

2. **Emergency Landing**
   - Press "Emergency Land" button
   - Confirm emergency action
   - Monitor descent

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized for 60fps performance
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- Minimal battery impact for extended operations

## Security Features
- Confirmation dialogs for critical actions
- Secure API communication
- Protected drone control commands

## Known Limitations
- Requires stable internet connection
- Google Maps dependency for mapping
- Battery consumption during extended tracking
